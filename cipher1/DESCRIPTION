//This was the final project in my programming one class. It is a vigenere cipher program that allows user to specify a text file and key word through the command line and either encipher or decipher that file. Uses alot of loops and ascii values to do the actual enciphering/deciphering, basically makes the key word the same length as the text file (by repeating it over and over) then subtracts the ascii value of whichever letter from the key word corrosponds to the letter in the text file.  Decipher function just undoes this same action.
